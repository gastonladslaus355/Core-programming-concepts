# Program Structure

## Concept
Program structure defines how a program is organized and executed as a whole.

## Why It Exists
Without structure, programs become unreadable, unmaintainable, and error-prone.

## Core Ideas
- Program entry point
- Execution flow
- Separation of responsibilities
- Compilation vs interpretation (conceptual)

## Cybersecurity Relevance
Understanding structure helps identify:
- Hidden execution paths
- Unauthorized entry points
- Malicious control flow

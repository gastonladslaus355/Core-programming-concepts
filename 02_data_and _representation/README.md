# Data and Data Representation

## Concept
How information is represented, stored, and interpreted by programs.

## Why It Exists
Computers operate on representations, not meaning.
Incorrect representation leads to logic and security flaws.

## Core Ideas
- Primitive vs composite data
- Abstraction
- Representation limits
- Encoding and interpretation

## Cybersecurity Relevance
Many vulnerabilities arise from:
- Incorrect assumptions about data
- Encoding and decoding errors
- Boundary violations

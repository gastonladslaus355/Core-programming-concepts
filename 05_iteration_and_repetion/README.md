## Concept
Repeating operations based on conditions.

## Why It Exists
Many problems require repeated processing.

## Core Ideas
- Finite vs infinite loops
- Loop invariants
- Termination conditions

## Cybersecurity Relevance
Loop flaws can cause:
- Denial of Service
- Resource exhaustion
- Infinite execution paths

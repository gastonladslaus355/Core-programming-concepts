# Functions and Modularity

## Concept
Breaking programs into reusable, independent units.

## Why It Exists
Modularity reduces complexity and improves correctness.

## Core Ideas
- Input/output contracts
- Encapsulation
- Reuse and abstraction

## Cybersecurity Relevance
Clear function boundaries help:
- Isolate vulnerabilities
- Reduce attack surface
- Enforce security controls

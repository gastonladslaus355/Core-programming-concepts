# Core Programming Foundations (Language-Independent)

## Purpose
This repository develops a deep, language-independent understanding of core programming concepts.
It focuses on *how programs work*, not on *how to write syntax in a specific language*.

The goal is to build strong mental models that apply across:
- All programming languages
- All paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.)
- All software domains, especially cybersecurity

## Why Language-Independent?
Programming languages change.
Concepts such as control flow, memory, data structures, errors, and concurrency do not.

By mastering these foundations, I will be able to:
- Learn new languages faster
- Read and audit unfamiliar code
- Reason about security risks at a design level
- Communicate effectively with developers as a cybersecurity professional

## Structure
Each module represents a fundamental concept layer.
Modules are studied sequentially, as each builds on earlier understanding.

Each module contains:
- README.md → Concept overview and purpose
- notes.md → Deep conceptual explanations
- self-test.md → Reasoning-based questions
- progress.md → Personal understanding audit

## Cybersecurity Relevance
This repository supports:
- Secure code review
- Vulnerability reasoning
- Threat modeling
- Architecture-level security decisions

This is a foundation repository — not a coding tutorial.

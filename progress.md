## Confidence Scale
- 0 – No understanding yet
- 1 – Familiar with terms only
- 2 – Partial understanding
- 3 – Solid understanding
- 4 – Can reason about edge cases and risks
- 5 – Can explain and apply across languages

---

## Review Rules
- Any module with confidence ≤ 2 must be revisited
- Security-related modules require confidence ≥ 4
- Progress is updated after each study session

---

## Reflection
Learning is measured by understanding and reasoning ability,
not by speed or volume of content.
